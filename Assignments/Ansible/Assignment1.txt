Learning Objectives:-
Install Ansible on the control host.
Create an `ansible` user on both the control host and workstation host being sure to set a password you can remember.
Configure a pre-shared key for Ansible that allows the user to log in from `control` to `workstation` without a password.
Configure the Ansible user on the workstation host so that Ansible may sudo without a password.
Create a simple inventory in `/home/ansible/inventory` consisting of only the `workstation` host.
Write an Ansible playbook in `/home/ansible/git-setup.yml` on the control node that installs `git` on `workstation` then execute the playbook.


Additional Information:-
You have been tasked with putting together a presentation to demonstrate how Ansible may be used to install software on remote hosts automatically. Before the demo, you will need to configure your test systems. You have been provided two hosts called control and workstation(Please create 2 Unix/Linux machine for the same). You will need to configure the ansible user on workstation to have sudo access without a password to the automated software installed via Ansible. You must also configure the control host as your Ansible control server by installing Ansible on it as well as configuring the Ansible user with a pre-shared key to login to the workstation host as the ansible user.

Once the basic configuration is complete, you will need to create a simple inventory in /home/ansible/inventory on the control server containing the workstation host. Afterward, you will write a simple playbook in /home/ansbile/git-setup.yml on the control host that installs git on the workstation host. You will need to make sure the playbook works by running it from the control server.

---
To install ansible on the control host 

install python 

Command: sudo apt-get install phython3 | pip

After pip has been installed install ansible using pip

Command : pip3 install ansible 

To create an user 

Command : user add ansible_user

To configure pre-shared key 

First generate an ssh key 

Command: ssh-keygen -t rsa

It will generate both private and public key 

Now copy the public key into the workstation node

sudo scp /home/sanskar/.ssh/id_rsa controller:/home/node/.ssh/authorized_keys

Now try to login 

ssh@ansible_node:192.168.10.72

Now in the workstation create an inventory file

Command : touch /home/sanskar/ansible/inventory.yml
Command : vi /home/sanskar/ansible/inventory.yml

all: 
  hosts: 
    192.168.99.100
	
To make no password entry 

Command : sudo visudo

Add the following line to the file and save:
ansible    ALL=(ALL)       NOPASSWD: ALL	
	
Now create the playbook 

Command : touch /home/sanskar/ansible/git-setup.yml

Command : vi /home/sanskar/ansible/git-setup.yml

- hosts: localhost
  tags: [ 'install-git' ] 
  tasks: 
   - package: 
      name: git 
      state: latest
	  
Now run the playbook 

Command : ansible-playbook -i inventory.yml git-setup.yml`
