Your supermarket company is working on expanding their Docker infrastructure. They have an existing service that provides a list of fruit sold in their stores. After measuring the amount of load on this service, they have asked you to scale this service up to a higher number of replicas.

In addition, there is a new service that provides a list of vegetables. This new service needs to be created in the cluster. Set up the swarm cluster to complete the lab, ensure that the swarm meets the following specifications:

1. Scale the service called products-fruit to 5 replicas.
2. Create a new service called products-vegetables running the linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0 image.
3. Publish products-vegetables on port 8081. The application listens on port 80.
4. Run products-vegetables with 3 replicas.

You can test the products-fruit service from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8080.

Once products-vegetables is running, you should be able to test it from any swarm node (including the manager) with curl localhost:8081.

Good luck!

-------------------
First we need to update the products-fruit service we can do it by creating docker-compose.yml file or docker service update command

Command : vi docker-compose.yml

version: "3"
services:
 products-fruit:
  image: linuxacademycontent/fruit-service:1.0.1
  ports:
   - "8080:80"
  deploy:
   replicas: 5
   
 products-vegetables:
  image: linuxacademycontent/vegetable-service:1.0.0
  ports:
   - "8081:80"
  deploy:
   replicas: 3
   
Now deploy the stack 

Command: docker stack deploy --compose-file docker-compose.yml myproducts
 
Now test running curl 
 
Command : curl localhost:8080

Command : curl localhost:8081
